## You will mainly work on 2 files
- [trainer_MaskDetector](https://github.com/yeasin50/faceMaskDetection/blob/master/trainer_MaskDetector.ipynb)
- [realTimeMaskDetectionModel11](https://github.com/yeasin50/faceMaskDetection/blob/master/realTimeMaskDetectionModel11.ipynb)

I assume you are able get libraries just by seeing import lines 

This is the path to dlibâ€™s pre-trained facial landmark detector. You can [download the detector model](http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2)

- DownLoad datasets to train model from [GDrive] (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1G5UTOx7QBEWPssUcMI1HIk-HpoYZlckU?usp=sharing)
- Extract on root directory and named as dataset or just navigate data path on [train_MaskDetector](https://github.com/yeasin50/faceMaskDetection/blob/master/trainer_MaskDetector.ipynb)
